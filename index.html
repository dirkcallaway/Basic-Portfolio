            <p>My name is Matt Perroni.  I am currently a teacher in Ft. Collins, CO.  I have taught elementary school for the past 13 years.
                I have taught 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades.  I have had the opportunity to travel and teach across Colorado, in Europe, and in Asia.
                I met my wife teaching in Western Colorado and have a passion for learning and teaching.  I run an after school LEGO Robotics club
                where I help students build, code, and compete in challenges.
            </p>

            <p>I graduated with a Human Development & Family Studies degree rom Colorado State University.  I completed my alternative teacher's license
                from Western State a year later.  After having taught for a few years I went back to school for a Master of Educational Technology degree from
                Boise State University.  I have had the opportunity to attend multiple professional development trainings and conferences from Apple to
                Google.  I am a Certified Google Educator and have become a go to person in my school for technology advice.
            </p>

            <p>For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by technology.  I remember being the one to have to call the technical service
                department to fix our family computer when I was in 5th grade.  About the same time I taught myself HTML from the Tu Cows website and built 
                multiple pages for my family and friends.  My original major in college was Computer Science and my passion for technology has never
                gone away.  I'm looking forward to learning more and applying it in a technology job in the near future.
